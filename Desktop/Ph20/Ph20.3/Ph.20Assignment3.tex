\title{\textbf{Derivation of analytical solution}}
\maketitle 

We know that the equation of motion for a simple block-on-spring system is $m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx$, or $m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0$. If we try a solution of the form $x(t) = e^{rt}$, we get $m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = (mr^2 + k)e^{rt}= 0$, which gives us the solutions $r = \pm i\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$. The frequency of oscillations is $\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$, and thus we can write the solution $x(t)$ as $x(t) = Ae^{-i\omega t} + Be^{i\omega t}$. Taking the real part gives us $x(t) = A'\cos{\omega t} + B'\sin{\omega t}$. Choosing suitable initial conditions gives us $x(t) = x(0)\cos{\omega t} + \frac{v(0)}{\omega}\sin{\omega t}$. Thus, we have found an analytical solution to the differential equation.

\title{\textbf{Solution to implicit Euler system}}
\maketitle 

The system evolves according to the equation: 

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -h \\
h & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{i+1} \\
v_{i+1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{i} \\
v_{i}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The square matrix is invertible if $h^2 \not=-1$ (i.e., if $h \not= i, -i$). Inverting this matrix gives us the equation:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{i+1} \\
v_{i+1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{1 + h^2} & \frac{h}{1 + h^2} \\
\frac{-h}{1 + h^2} & \frac{1}{1 + h^2}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{i} \\
v_{i}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Since $h << 1$, we can approximate $1 + h^2 \approx 1$, and arrive at 

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{i+1} \\
v_{i+1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & h\\
-h & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{i} \\
v_{i}
\end{pmatrix}
\Rightarrow
\begin{array}
{lcl} x_{i+1} & = & x_{i}  +  hv_{i}\\ 
v_{i+1} & = & -hx_{i}  + v_{i} 
\end{array}
$$

Thus, we can use the explicit Euler method to evaluate $(x_{i+1}, v_{i+1})$, and then feed these solutions into the implicit Euler method.

As we can see, both plots oscillate sinusoidally for velocity and displacement, and match the exact solution almost identically. All plots are made with $x(0) = 1$, $v(0) = 0$, $t(0) = 0$, and $h = .001$.}

\caption{Phase space plot of $x$ vs. $v$ for the explicit (left) and implicit (right) Euler methods. Both plots spiral clockwise, with the explicit plot growing outwards with time and the implicit plot growing inwards with time. This is consistent with the energy $E = x^2 + v^2$ of the explicit plot, increasing with time, and the energy of the implicit plot decreasing with time. Both plots are made with $x(0) = 1$, $v(0) = 0$, $t(0) = 0$, and $h = .001$.}

While there are errors in the symplectic method, the errors oscillate sinusoidally (see figure 7), so they average out and the phase space curves appear to match. Both plots are made with $x(0) = 1$, $v(0) = 0$, $t(0) = 0$, and $h = .001$.}
